# Nixfiles

A repository containing the configuration files for my NixOS machine. There are
plans on expanding this across my different devices using the Nix package
manager, but I haven't gotten the motivation to do that yet.

## Directories

- `home-manager`: Stores all of my userland packages & configurations
- `nixos`: Stores all of my system-wide configurations
- `nvim`: My Neovim configuration, slightly modified for NixOS
